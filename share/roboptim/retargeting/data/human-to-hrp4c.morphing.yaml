# ROBOPTIM-RETARGETING MORPHING FILE (YAML)
#
# Description:
# ------------
# This is a morphing file as supported by roboptim-retargeting.
#
# This files links a marker set to a robot body by specifying the
# relative position of each marker on each body of the robot.
#
# If this file do not mention a particular marker and/or robot body,
# it has to be excluded from the optimization process.
#
# This file:
# ----------
#
# This files allows the marker set "human.mars" to be morphed to the
# HRP4C robot structure. HRP4C model is freely available on internet.
#
#
# IMPORTANT: please note that the roboptim-retargeting test suite rely
# on this file, you will HAVE to update the test suite (see
# tests/marker-mapping.cc for instance) if you change this file!
