# ROBOPTIM-RETARGETING MORPHING FILE (YAML)
#
# Description:
# ------------
# This is a morphing file as supported by roboptim-retargeting.
#
# This files links a marker set to a robot body by specifying the
# relative position of each marker on each body of the robot.

# If this file do not mention a particular marker and/or robot body,
# it has to be excluded from the optimization process.
#
